# Water turbines

Gravitational or kinetic energy to electrical energy convertion using water and gravity trough a rotary machine.

## Efficiency

**EROI:** 40 - 250 <sup>[source](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/eroi-behind-numbers-energy-return-investment/)</sup>

## Power

The power available in a stream of water is;

`P = n * p * g * h * q`

where:

`P` = power (J/s or watts)

`n` = turbine efficiency [~90% in average]

`p` = density of water (kg/m³) [1000]

`g` = acceleration of gravity (m/s²) [9.81]

`h` = head (m). For still water, this is the difference in height between the inlet and outlet surfaces. Moving water has an additional component added to account for the kinetic energy of the flow. The total head equals the pressure head plus velocity head.

`q` = flow rate (m³/s)
