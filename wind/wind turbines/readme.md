## Efficiency

**EROI:** 20-36.5 <sup>[source 1](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/eroi-behind-numbers-energy-return-investment/), [source 2](https://sites.google.com/site/anatomyofglobalclimatechangevj/data-and-analysis)</sup>

## Power

Not all the energy of blowing wind can be used, but some small wind turbines are designed to work at low wind speeds. <sup>[source](http://www.greenoptimistic.com/small-scale-dragonfly-like-wind-turbine-works-low-wind-speed-20131028/)</sup>

Conservation of mass requires that the amount of air entering and exiting a turbine must be equal. Accordingly, Betz's law gives the maximal achievable extraction of wind power by a wind turbine as 16/27 (59.3%) of the total kinetic energy of the air flowing through the turbine.<sup>[source](http://apps.carleton.edu/campus/library/digitalcommons/assets/pacp_7.pdf)</sup>

where `œÅ` is the air density.

To protect components from undue wear, extracted power is held constant above the rated operating speed as theoretical power increases at the cube of wind speed, further reducing theoretical efficiency. In 2001, commercial utility-connected turbines deliver 75% to 80% of the Betz limit of power extractable from the wind, at rated operating speed. <sup>[source 1](https://web.archive.org/web/20110516022444/http://www.enercon.de/p/downloads/EN_Productoverview_0710.pdf), [source 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:BookSources/0471489972)</sup>
