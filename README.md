# Awesome ecotechnology

Ecotechnology is defined as the use of technological means for ecosystem management based on deep understanding of principles on which natural ecological systems are built and on the transfer of such principles into ecosystem management in a way to minimize the costs of the measures and their harm to the global environment.

## Energy return on investment (EROI)

EROI = Energy delivered / energy required to deliver this energy.

> If you’ve got an EROI of 1.1:1, you can pump the oil out of the ground and look at it. If you’ve got 1.2:1, you can refine it and look at it. At 1.3:1, you can move it to where you want it and look at it. We looked at the minimum EROI you need to drive a truck, and you need at least 3:1 at the wellhead. Now, if you want to put anything in the truck, like grain, you need to have an EROI of 5:1. And that includes the depreciation for the truck. But if you want to include the depreciation for the truck driver and the oil worker and the farmer, then you’ve got to support the families. And then you need an EROI of 7:1. And if you want education, you need 8:1 or 9:1. And if you want health care, you need 10:1 or 11:1. 

-Professor Charles Hall, the father of EROI.

## Substainable energy production technology (EROI > 11:1 && non-fossil)

* Water
  * [Water turbines](https://github.com/Primerz/awesome-ecotechnology/tree/master/water/water%20turbines)
  * Underwater turbines
* Wind
  * [Wind turbines](https://github.com/Primerz/awesome-ecotechnology/tree/master/wind/wind%20turbines)
  * [Bladeless wind turbines](http://vortexbladeless.com/)

## Substainable energy extraction

* [Heat pump](https://energy.gov/energysaver/heat-pump-systems) (can heat water 2 to 3 times more efficiently than an ordinary electric water heater.)
